## WEBSITE VISITORS

Like most website operators, Github collects non-personally-identifying information of the sort that web browsers and servers typically make available, such as the browser type, language preference, referring site, and the date and time of each visitor request. We do use Github pages to host this privacy policy but we do not use any non-personally-identifying information that Github themselves might acquire.

## EXCLUSION

This privacy policy does not apply to any unsolicited information you provide to us, such as feature requests and feedback sent via our support channels. All unsolicited information shall be deemed to be non-confidential and we shall be free to reproduce, use, disclose, and distribute such unsolicited information to others without limitation or attribution.

## DISCLAIMER

While we continue to work hard to protect your data, no transmission over the Internet can be guaranteed to be absolutely secure, and we cannot ensure or warrant the security of any information you transmit to us. Transmitting personal information is done at your own risk.

## PRIVACY POLICY CHANGES

If we makes changes to any terms or conditions of this privacy policy, these changes will be posted on the site in a timely manner. We reserve the right to modify this privacy policy at any time, so please review it frequently. In case of a business transaction in which this app is acquired, we will notify you as described above in this paragraph.

## Daily Flash Cards for Kanji

Kanji Love is a simple kanji flash card app for the Apple Watch. A convenient way to building up your memory of thousands of kanji characters. 

PLEASE NOTE: Kanji Love does require you to know hiragana/katakana since it does expect you to be able to read them. This is not an app for pure beginner Japanese learners. There are much better apps for that.
